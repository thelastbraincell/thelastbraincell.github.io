According to the latest United Nations Population Prospects report, the global median age as of the year 2020 was estimated to be 30.9 years, On August 25, 1989, at the time when half of our world’s current population wasn’t even born, Voyager 2, the second of the two spacecrafts sent into space under the Voyager Mission undertaken by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and funded by NASA, had already become the first human-made entity to visit 4 planetary bodies when it made its contact with the planet Neptune. At the time of writing this blog, the spacecraft travelled a distance about 3.3 times further, with a speed of about 15km/s taken relative to the Sun. These details, though insignificant, give a sublime insight into the limitless boundaries that we as a species have always and continue to push, which renders even the Earth, the place we call our home, nothing more than a pale blue dot on the cosmic canvas.

To get a better cognizance of the Voyager program, we first look at a concept known as Gravity Assist, more commonly known as the Slingshot Effect. This effect is an aeronautical concept that is used to change the velocity of a spacecraft using the gravitational pull of an astronomical object, enabling the said spacecraft to travel a more considerable distance using less amounts of fuel. In layman's terms, the movement of the spacecraft is analogous to that of a ball bouncing off after a collision with a moving wall. In 1964, Gary Flandro, an aerospace engineer at the JPL performed calculations that revealed a possible alignment of the 4 planets of the outer solar system i.e. Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune in the late 1970s that would, theoretically, enable a spacecraft to visit all these planets though slingshots, using gravity assists from each planet to swing on to the next. It was also noted that such an alignment occurs once approximately every 176 years. Subsequently, a Grand Tour Program was devised, which, due to budgetary reasons, proved to be the foundation of the Voyager missions.

In the fall of 1977, Voyager 1 (September 5) and Voyager 2 (August 20) were launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida near NASA’s Kennedy Space Center. Although Voyager 2 was launched first, the difference in trajectories of the two spacecrafts allowed Voyager 1 to reach the outer planets earlier, hence the etymology. Voyager 2 was planned to visit Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, whereas Voyager 1’s trajectory was designed to provide an optimal path to Titan, the biggest of Saturn’s moons and the second-largest moon in our solar system. Each of the spacecraft weighs close to 1700 pounds, including scientific instruments, guidance systems, and electronics. Additionally, the most interesting component of both the spacecrafts is something referred to as the Voyager Golden Record. These records, intended to be discovered by any plausible extraterrestrial contact, contain select sounds and images to portray life on Earth. The contents for these records were chosen by a committee chaired by Carl Edward Sagan of Cornell University. These included more than 100 images, an assortment of sounds from nature such as wind and water; sounds made by humans, such as laughter and music from different time periods; and human greetings, spoken in more than 55 languages, including Hindi, Marathi, Kannada, Bengali, Gujarati, Oriya, Punjabi, Rajasthani, Urdu and Telugu from Indian languages. The record also includes a printed message from then-U.S. president Jimmy Carter. In addition, Emmy-winning director and Sagan’s wife, Ann Druyan, was chosen for an hour-long recording of brainwaves to be loaded on the record, containing thoughts about Earth’s history, past civilizations, industrial development over the centuries, and falling in love.

Since the program’s inception close to 45 years ago, both the spacecrafts have achieved significant milestones, both in terms of distance travelled and astronomical entities encountered. Around 20 months after its launch, Voyager 1 made its closest approach to Jupiter and gathered significant data on previously unknown phenomena such as the Jovian ring system, and the presence of a magnetic field, active volcanoes, and lightning on both Jupiter and its revolving moons. Another significant discovery was that the Great Red Spot on Jupiter, which is visible from our planet, is actually a huge, everlasting cyclone, about 2 times the size of Earth. This was followed by Voyager 2’s encounter with Jupiter about 4 months later. Over the next 10 years (1979-1989), the spacecrafts carried on their duties, and the Voyager primary mission was concluded when Voyager 2 made its closest approach to Neptune. Beyond the outer planets, the next checkpoint that exists in our Sun’s solar system is the Heliopause Boundary, which marks the limit of the Sun's magnetic field. This boundary exists at a distance of 3 times from Neptune than that between Neptune and Earth. The space that exists beyond this boundary is referred to as the Interstellar Space. Measurements performed in this interstellar region would be unaffected by the so-called Solar Winds, and more representative data would be obtained. A mission extension, known as the Voyager Interstellar Mission (VIM) was kicked off after the conclusion of the above-mentioned primary mission, with the objective of extending the exploration of the solar system beyond the outer planets and continuing the running of the two voyager spacecrafts for as long as possible. Once the flyby to Neptune was completed, the cameras on Voyager 2 were turned off, to use the power of other instruments. On February 14, 1990, in arguably one of the greatest moments in humankind’s space exploration history, Voyager 1’s final image of the mission was taken, which was called The Solar System Family Portrait or more commonly, The Family Portrait, which is a series of images that capture Venus, Earth and the outer planets arrayed around the Sun.

The Voyager twins continued their journey, breaking records by becoming the farthest human-made object from Earth in space (Voyager 1: February 17, 1998) and the longest operating space mission (Voyager 2: August 13, 2012). In 2004, Voyager 1 reached the Termination Shock, which marks the inner boundary of the Heliopause and where interaction between the solar and the interstellar wind takes place. Finally, on August 25, 2012, 12753 days after its launch, Voyager 1 became the first human-made entity to reach interstellar space and made its first measurements of a non-celestial body affected magnetic fields. On November 5, 2018, Voyager 2 entered interstellar space as well. The following approach of the Voyager twins to an astronomical body will be an obscure star in the Ursa Minor constellation, referred to as AC+793888. The closest distance from the star will be 1.6 light years, and the approach is projected to happen in 40,272 AD.

The effect of the Voyager mission on humankind and in the field of space research can be summarized by this statement from Stephen Pyne, an environmental history professor from Arizona State University:

*"Voyager did things no one predicted, found scenes no one expected, and promises to outlive its inventors. Like a great painting or an abiding institution, it has acquired an existence of its own, a destiny beyond the grasp of its handlers."*

The current distance of Voyager 1 from Earth is 14.5 billion miles. To put forth a  comparison, it takes about 8 minutes and 20 seconds for the Sun's light to reach Earth; any data transmitted from Voyager 1, travelling at the speed of light, takes about 21 hours and 35 minutes to reach Earth. The first powered aircraft completed its first flight in 1903, and in barely 70 years’ time, which is a minuscule period compared to mankind’s history, these flying machines, capable of reaching distances that were beyond our wildest imaginations and reliable enough to keep working for half a century later, is a testimony to the raw talent and spectacular prowess of mind that we as a species possess. When the images of the Family Portrait were first received from Voyager 1, Carl Sagan had this to say:

*"Consider again that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us...The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena... To my mind, there is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly and compassionately with one another and to preserve and cherish that pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known."*

The story of the Voyager program is one of endurance, trust, and expectations. Endurance to keep moving forward into the unknown, to keep exploring and learning. Trust between a mind and a machine to create something that will be remembered long after the mind is gone. Expectations for one day to find something, maybe someone, at the boundaries of the perceivable cosmos.

Since the beginning of time, humanity has displayed an insatiable curiosity, to venture into the unknown, to expand our knowledge, and to deepen our comprehension. This has catalyzed remarkable advancements in every field, which continue to shape our lifestyles. Across generations, achievements that once eluded our grandparents have become commonplace fears, and with each passing generation, we move towards a more enlightened state. When we revisit and contemplate these achievements, the Voyager Missions, launched over 40 years ago, serve as a collective embodiment of the human will for its quest for knowledge and indomitable spirit of discovery. These missions are a testament to our innate yearning and it’s journey symbolizes not only a pursuit of scientific understanding but also an unwavering dedication to unravel the secrets woven into the fabric of our world. It represents the essence of our species' continuous pursuit that transcends any limitations and illuminates our path through an infinite universe that we live in.
