Just two friends who have known each other for 6 years now, [Abhinav][Abhinav] and [Yash][Yash] did their undergrad from IIT Bombay. Abhinav now works as a software engineer, while Yash is doing a PhD in Canada. Although career paths have taken them in different directions, qualities like overthinking, ultra-analysing and procrastinating on writing a blog remain strong. Some of the blogs that you will find here are factual; real stories that put forth a bigger, generalised idea and others are gonna be abstract, which come from various experiences that us or you might face day to day. Hoping to keep this blog full of interesting posts as it moves forward, and hope you like reading them!
